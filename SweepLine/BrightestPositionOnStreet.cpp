/*
ðŸ§  Approach: Line Sweep using Ordered Map

1. Every light [pos, range] lights up the interval [pos - range, pos + range].
   We treat this as a range update using difference array logic.

2. For each light:
   - Add +1 at (pos - range)
   - Add -1 at (pos + range + 1)
   This means: brightness increases at the start and decreases just after the end.

3. Store all these changes in a map<int, int> (auto-sorted by position).

4. Traverse all positions in increasing order:
   - Maintain currentBrightness by adding deltas from the map.
   - Track the maximum brightness and update bestPosition accordingly.
   - If brightness is tied, take the smaller position.

5. Return the position with maximum brightness (smallest in case of tie).

 Time Complexity: O(N log N) due to map insertions and traversal
 Space Complexity: O(N) for storing all brightness change events
