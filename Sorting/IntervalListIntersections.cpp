/**
Approach:
We are given two lists of non-overlapping intervals, sorted by start time.
The goal is to find all overlapping intervals (intersections) between the two lists.

Steps:
1. Use two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate over both interval lists.
2. For each pair (firstList[i], secondList[j]):
   - Compute the maximum start and minimum end.
   - If they overlap (`start <= end`), add the intersection to the result.
3. Move the pointer whose interval ends first â€” this ensures no overlapping intervals are skipped.

Why it works:
- Since both input lists are sorted and disjoint, a two-pointer traversal guarantees all matches are checked efficiently.

Time Complexity:
- O(N + M), where N and M are the sizes of the two input lists.

Space Complexity:
- O(K), where K is the number of intersections added to the result.
