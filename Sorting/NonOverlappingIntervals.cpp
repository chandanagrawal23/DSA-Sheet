/**
Approach:
We want to remove the "minimum number of overlapping intervals" from a list to make the rest non-overlapping.

1. First, we sort the intervals by their start time.
2. We iterate over the sorted list and compare the current interval with the previously chosen non-overlapping interval.
   - If they "overlap" (i.e., current start < previous end), we "remove one".
     To make a greedy decision, we keep the one that ends "earlier" so that it has "less chance to overlap" with upcoming intervals.
   - If they donâ€™t overlap, we move forward and update the currEnd.

This is a classic greedy strategy where we try to "remove the interval" that could cause more future overlaps.

Time Complexity:
- O(N log N) due to sorting.

Space Complexity:
- O(1) extra space (in-place).

Note:
To avoid overlap, always choose the interval with the earliest end time among overlapping options.
