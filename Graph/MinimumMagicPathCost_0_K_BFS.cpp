/*
ðŸ§© Problem: Minimum Magic Path Cost

You are given a 2D grid of size m x n. Each cell contains a magic cost between 0 and 3.

From any cell (i, j), you can move to one of its 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right) if within bounds.

Each move costs the **magic value of the destination cell**.

Your task is to find the minimum total cost to reach the bottom-right cell (m-1, n-1) from the top-left cell (0, 0).

ðŸ”¸ Constraints:
- 1 <= m, n <= 500
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 3

ðŸ”¹ Input:
grid = [
  [0, 1, 2],
  [3, 2, 1],
  [0, 1, 0]
]

ðŸ”¹ Output:
2

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:
(0,0) â†’ (1,1) â†’ (2,2) = 0 + 2 + 0 = âœ… 2 (minimum total cost)

/*
ðŸ§  Detailed Approach (0â€“k BFS):

- Edge weights are integers from 0 to 3 â†’ so we use bucketed BFS (aka 0â€“k BFS).
- Instead of a normal queue, we maintain multiple "buckets" (deques) â€” one for each possible cost mod (k+1).
- Each cell push is done to the correct bucket based on its total cost.
- We process buckets in increasing cost order without using a heap.
- This gives us Dijkstra-level accuracy without the overhead of a priority queue.

ðŸ“ˆ Time Complexity: O(m * n * k), where k = 3 â†’ practically linear for small k.
ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity: O(m * n + k)

âœ… This technique is super useful when edge weights are small bounded integers like 0, 1, 2, 3.
