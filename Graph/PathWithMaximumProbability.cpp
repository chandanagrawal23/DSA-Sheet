/*
Approach:

- Treat the graph as a weighted graph with edge weights as probabilities.
- Goal: Maximize product of probabilities from `start` to `end`.
- Use a max-heap (priority_queue) and a greedy Dijkstra-style approach:
    - At each step, pick the node with the highest probability.
    - Update neighbor's probability only if it improves.
    - Stop early if we reach the target node (`end`).

Key Point:
- Instead of summing weights like in standard Dijkstra, we multiply probabilities.

Time Complexity:  O(E * log V)
  - E = number of edges, V = number of nodes.

Space Complexity: O(V + E)
  - For adjacency list and probability tracking.
