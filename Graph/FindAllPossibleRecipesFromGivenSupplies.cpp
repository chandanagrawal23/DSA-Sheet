/*
Approach:
---------
- Build a dependency graph (adjacency list) where each ingredient maps to the recipes that depend on it.
- Use an indegree map to count how many ingredients each recipe still needs before it can be made.
- Add all the initial supplies to a queue (these are ingredients we already have).
- Use BFS (Kahn's Topological Sort) to simulate the process:
    - For each available ingredient, reduce the indegree of all recipes that use it.
    - If a recipe's indegree becomes 0, we can now make it â€” add it to result and push it to queue.
- Continue this until the queue is empty.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- O(R + I), where R = number of recipes, I = total number of ingredients across all recipes.

Space Complexity:
-----------------
- O(R + I), for graph and indegree tracking.
