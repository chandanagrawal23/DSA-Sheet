/*

Approach:
==========
- Sort all courses by their deadline (lastDay).
- Use a max heap to track durations of courses we've taken.
- Iterate over each course:
   - If it fits within current time, take it and add its duration.
   - If not, and it's shorter than the longest course taken so far â†’ replace it.
- Greedy logic: Always keep total time low by keeping shortest durations possible.

Time: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n log n) for heap operations
Space: O(n) for heap
