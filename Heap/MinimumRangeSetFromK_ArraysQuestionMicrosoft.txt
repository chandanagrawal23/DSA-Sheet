/*

Minimum Range Set from K Arrays
===================================

Problem Statement
-----------------------

You are given k arrays, each containing integers.
Your task is to select exactly one element from each array such that:
  The difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the selected set is minimized.
If multiple sets yield the same minimum difference, you may return any one of them.

Return the set of selected elements and the minimum difference.

Input Format
--------------
First line: An integer k (number of arrays).
Next k lines: Each line contains space-separated integers representing an array.

Output Format
-------------
Print the selected set of elements (one element from each array) and Print the minimum difference (max(selected) - min(selected)).

Constraints
---------------

2 <= k <= 10^3
1 <= length of each array <= 10^3
-10^6 <= array[i] <= 10^6
Total number of elements across all arrays ≤ 10^5

Example 1
##########
Input
------
3
7 3 9
5 11 6
8 2 10

Output
-------
7 6 8
2

Explanation
--------------

Possible set [7, 6, 8] has max = 8, min = 6 → difference = 2.
Another valid set [9, 11, 10] also gives difference = 2.
Minimum possible difference = 2.

Example 2
##########
Input
--------
4
30 1 20
25 15
28 35 17
40 5 27

Output
---------
30 25 28 27
5

Explanation
--------------
Set [30, 25, 28, 27] has max = 30, min = 25 → difference = 5.
Another possible set [30, 25, 35, 40] gives difference = 15, which is worse.
Hence the optimal set is [30, 25, 28, 27].

Example 3
##########

Input
------
2
1 5 9
3 8 12

Output
------
9 8
1
  
Explanation
-----------

Selecting 9 from first array and 8 from second → max = 9, min = 1 → difference = 1.
This is the smallest possible difference.
