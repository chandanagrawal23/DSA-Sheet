/*
Approach Explanation:

- Problem:
    Given a list of fruit positions and their quantities, and a starting point, we want to collect
    maximum fruits by visiting a contiguous segment within at most K steps.

- Brute-force idea:
    1. For each pair (i, j) of fruit positions, check if we can collect fruits in range [i..j].
    2. Compute the minimum steps to cover both ends starting from startPos:
           steps = min(|start - left|, |start - right|) + (right - left)
    3. If steps <= K, accumulate fruits in that segment.
    4. Keep track of the maximum total collected.

- Why this works:
    The logic for steps ensures that we visit the entire interval [left...right] optimally â€”
    starting from the nearer end and sweeping to the farther one.

- Time Complexity: O(N^2)
    Because we are considering all pairs (i, j) in nested loops.

- Space Complexity: O(1)
    No extra space used apart from a few variables.

/*
Approach:
-----------
- Use sliding window on the sorted fruit positions.
- Keep a window [left...right] where all positions are visitable within k steps.
- For each valid window, calculate total fruits collected.
- To check if a window is valid:
    min(abs(start - left), abs(start - right)) + (right - left) <= k
- Update max fruits collected during traversal.

Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
