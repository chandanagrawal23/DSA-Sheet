/*
Approach:
- A number n is prime if it is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.
- For optimization, we loop from 2 to sqrt(n) instead of 2 to n-1.
  - This is because a larger factor of n must be paired with a smaller one already checked.
- If we find any number in this range that divides n, it's not prime.

Time Complexity:
- O(âˆšn), since we only check up to the square root of n.

Space Complexity:
- O(1), constant space used.
